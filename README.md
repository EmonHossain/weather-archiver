# Archiving Weather Data

Create an application which periodically fetches weather data from [wttr.in](https://wttr.in/)'s JSON API and saves it in a database. 

You needn't save all available data, but at the very least, save the current temperature.

The application must provide a REST API to query for aggregated values over the saved data, e.g. getting the max/min/avg temperature of the past 24 hours.

## Technology Choice

The technology choice is up to you, but you must provide instructions on how to run the code.
Running it from an IDE is not acceptable because production software also isn't run from the IDE.

## Final Remarks

If in doubt, ask!
